# I2c
An I2C driver template and implementation for some embedded systems targets. 
The driver is blocking, asynchronous and limited to sending/receiving single byte at a time. 
It's made with time tirggered design in mind.

# Acknowledgment
The pattern is taken from the book <b>Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems</b> <i>by Michael J. Pont</i>
